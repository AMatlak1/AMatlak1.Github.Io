       <h3>Java 2D Game Project Cyborgs vs Humans</h3>
       <p>
       My Java 2D Game project is a game called Cyborgs vs Humans<br>
       this game consists of the player, being the cyborg which has to protect<br>
       himself from the human's that are out to kill his kind. The game consists of 3<br>
       levels which gradually get harder, as the player move's through the level's more<br>
       complicated platform's are added to the game such as moving platform or harder<br>
       enemy's to kill, also the player must be careful to not come into contact with<br>
       some of the enemy's such as the Rock Human or the Cap Human, if the player comes<br>
       into contact with these enemy's they will be transported straight to level one<br>
       and die.</p>


       <p>
        This 2D Java Game project allowed me the opportunity to learn more about<br>
        GUI's, working with files and also it allowed me to to learn more about<br>
        object oriented programming. Also another lesson i learned from this is about <br>
        the game user interface and how the characters interact with collision from enemy's<br>
        and objects.
